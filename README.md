## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm run setup`
3. Get to work.

## Development Workflow:

1. Make changes to plugin files
2. Make changes in `demo` that would test those changes out
3. `npm run demo.ios` or `npm run demo.android`  **(must be run from the root directory)**

Those `demo` tasks are just general helpers. You may want to have more granular control on the device and/or emulator you want to run. For that, you can just run things the manual way:

```
cd demo

// when developing, to ensure the latest code is built into the demo, it's a gaurantee to remove the plugin and add it back
tns plugin remove nativescript-pdf-viewer
tns plugin add ..

# manual platform adds
tns platform add ios
tns platform add android
```

Then use any of the available options from the `tns` command line:

* [Emulate your project](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli#emulate-your-project)
* [Run your project](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli#run-your-project)
