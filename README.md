# nativescript-pdf-view

This is a very basic PDF view implementation that does only one thing, and
that is to display PDF files. It conveniently uses the iOS `UIWebView`, but
for Android it uses AndroidPdfView.

This plugin does the bare minimum required to render the PDF, no configuration
options, and no error handling have been built yet. I welcome all Pull Requests!
